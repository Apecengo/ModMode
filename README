## ModMode ##
*Keeping staff and players separate since 1869*

#### Configuration Example
    vanished: []
    fullvanished: []
    modmode: []

       flight: true

`vanished`, `fullvanished` and `modmode` are used internally and should not be manually edited.

The config option `allow.flight` will allow ModMode players to fly.
