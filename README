## ModMode ##
*Keeping staff and players separate since 1869*

#### Configuration Example
    vanished: []
    modmode: []
    allow:
       flight: true

`vanished`, and `modmode` are used internally and should not be manually edited.

The config option `allow.flight` will allow ModMode players to fly. If not configured it will default to false.

This now requires LogBlock to build, we could not find a maven repo with LogBlock in it, so you will need to grab the source code from [here](https://github.com/LogBlock/LogBlock/) and then run

```
mvn clean install
```
